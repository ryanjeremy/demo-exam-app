# Demo Exam App

This is a demo app that offers a short programming quiz to inexperienced coders. We'll be using Express.js to serve a simple API service and React.js to serve the front end application.

## Getting Started

To get started and install the dependancies for both the client and server, and then run the application, go ahead and execute the following two commands:

```
yarn install-dependencies
yarn start
```
